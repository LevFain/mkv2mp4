This is a small mkv to mp4 converter project.

Today I needed to convert some mkv files to mp4, but all programs I found were garbage...
so I made this application.

Very simple use-
1. dump you mkv's into the files folder.
2. start mkv2mp4.bat
3. you will be asked if you need audio or not, output will depend on your choise.
4. it will convert all .mkv files in that folder and output them to "output" folder

you can delete the example files, had to upload them to make the folder upload with the project...
